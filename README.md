# ECE 482 Final Project
Repository for the ECE 482 final project.

## Project Information
In this project, we design a 16:1 serializer and a 1:16 deserializer in 45-nm CMOS technology. We also design a pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) generator circuit, which provides the test data for our transmission system.
